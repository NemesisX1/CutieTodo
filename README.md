# CutieTodo App ðŸ“±ðŸ–‰

Cutie Todo is a Dart full stack web application made to help you remind yourself about what you have to do. This project was made as a simple proof of concept that it is possible to build a production-ready app with Dart in both backend and frontend.

[Screenshots needed]

> ## ðŸ‘€ Overview

I have made:

- a client made with Flutter. You can have more details here
- a backend make up wit [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/) and [Dart Frog](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev) and provide JWT as athentication method and a structure partly inspired by [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/). You can have more details about how it was made and understand the process here

> ### ðŸ’¥ Future

Maybe maintaining it add features and let the community push it forward (or not ðŸ’€)
